## 1. Fixed QR Window Closing Issue

### Problem
When closing the QR code popup window, the entire Flask server was shutting down, forcing users to restart the application.

### Solution
- **Changed server thread**: Modified from `daemon=False` to `daemon=True` to run independently
- **Separate QR thread**: Moved the QR window display to its own daemon thread
- **Proper thread management**: Closing the QR window no longer affects the server
- **User feedback**: Added informative text in the QR popup: "Closing this window will NOT stop the server"
- **Improved main loop**: Enhanced main thread loop to keep server running independently

### Technical Changes
```python
# Before: Server thread was non-daemon and blocked by QR window
server_thread = threading.Thread(target=run_server, daemon=False)

# After: Server runs independently, QR window in separate thread
server_thread = threading.Thread(target=run_server, daemon=True)
qr_thread = threading.Thread(target=show_qr_window, daemon=True)
```

### Files Modified
- `app.py` - Threading logic and QR window behavior

## 2. Modern Frontend Redesign

### QR Code Widget Transformation

#### Before
- QR code displayed prominently in the center of the page
- Took up significant screen space
- Always visible, cluttering the interface

#### After

- **Expandable panel**: Click to show/hide QR code
- **Smooth animations**: Professional cubic-bezier transitions
- **Auto-close**: Closes when clicking outside the widget
- **Full functionality**: Scan QR, copy URL, all features preserved

### Visual Design Enhancements

#### QR Widget Styling
- Gradient background: `linear-gradient(135deg, #3b82f6, #2563eb)`

## 3. Server Clipboard Image Copy Fix

### Problem
The "Copy" button in the Server Clipboard section worked well for text but failed to copy images to the client's clipboard, making it difficult for users to use server clipboard images.

### Solution: Multi-Method Image Copy Strategy

Implemented a robust, multi-layered approach with automatic fallbacks to ensure images can be copied across all browsers and scenarios.

#### Method 1: Modern Clipboard API (Primary)
```javascript
// Uses latest browser API
await navigator.clipboard.write([
    new ClipboardItem({
        'image/png': blob
    })
]);
```
- Converts base64 image data to PNG blob
- Works in modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Safari)
- Best performance and reliability

#### Method 2: Canvas-Based Copy (Fallback)
```javascript
// Creates canvas and draws image
const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0);
canvas.toBlob(async (blob) => {
    await navigator.clipboard.write([...]);
});
```
- Creates temporary canvas element
- Draws image onto canvas
- Converts canvas to blob
- Better browser compatibility than direct blob method

#### Method 3: ContentEditable Selection (Final Fallback)
```javascript
// Uses older execCommand method
const tempDiv = document.createElement('div');
tempDiv.contentEditable = true;
tempDiv.appendChild(imgClone);
document.execCommand('copy');
```
- Creates temporary contenteditable div
- Clones image element into it
- Uses `document.execCommand('copy')`
- Works in older browsers and edge cases

#### Method 4: User Guidance
- If all automated methods fail, provides clear instructions
- Suggests: "Right-click the image and select 'Copy Image'"
- Ensures users always have a way to copy the image

### Additional Features

#### Download Button for Images
- **Icon-only button**: Download icon (üì•) appears only for images
- **Smart visibility**: Hidden for text content to keep UI clean
- **Timestamp filename**: Downloads as `clipboard_image_[timestamp].png`
- **Fallback option**: Alternative if clipboard copy doesn't work
- **Responsive design**: Adapts to screen size

#### Visual Feedback System
- ‚úÖ **Success messages**: "Image copied to clipboard successfully"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning messages**: Helpful instructions if automated copy fails
- ‚ùå **Error handling**: User-friendly error messages
- üìä **Status indicators**: Clear feedback for every action

### Browser Compatibility Matrix

| Browser | Method 1 | Method 2 | Method 3 | Overall |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|---------|
| Chrome/Edge | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Excellent |
| Firefox | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Good |
| Safari | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Full | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited | ‚úÖ Good |
| Older Browsers | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Full | ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic |

### User Experience Flow

1. **Fetch Content**: User clicks "Fetch" button
2. **Display Content**: Image appears in Server Clipboard area
3. **Show Options**: Both "Copy" and download buttons become available
4. **Copy Attempt**: User clicks "Copy"
   - System tries Method 1 (Modern API)
   - If fails, tries Method 2 (Canvas)
   - If fails, tries Method 3 (ContentEditable)
   - If all fail, shows helpful instructions
5. **Feedback**: User receives clear success or guidance message
6. **Alternative**: User can click download button to save image directly
